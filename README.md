# Welcome to Chainfix

Chainfix provides a way to represent numbers and perform math operations using fixed-point data types.

Chainfix supports binary fixed-point (base-2), decimal fixed-point (base-10)
and even arbitrary (base-N) fixed-point types.

Fixed-point data types are used in a wide range of computing applications. 
Binary-fixed point types are commonly used in the design of specialized hardware, 
FPGAs, ASICS, and signal processing applications.  

Decimal-fixed point types are commonly found in financial applications, blockchain, 
decentralized finance, and smart contracts
(e.g. the [solidity programming language](https://docs.soliditylang.org/).
